Locales System (LS) -- is a system that allow you to manage various texts in your game easily. With this system you can add
multiple languages to your game and load texts on these languages dynamically. 

Native LS is divided in two parts:
1) In-Game Text (IGT);
2) Dialogue System (DS);

Each part consists of units.

IGT consists of one type of unit -- IGT unit, and DS consists of three types of units -- Replicas, Commantaries and Choices.

Locales system has its own drawing class, that allows you to use some advanced techniques such as:
* Coloring text in parts
* Setting up sounds for each symbol, that can be useful when drawing character's replica
* Shaking text in parts (whole fragment or each character)
* Make letters wave~
* Setting up text speed for each fragment of text
* Waiting after drawing certain symbol
* Setting text boundaries, which automatic wrapping system uses

There are formatting codes such as:

Coloring:
<&Red>Hello!</&>. Note: you can use monogame colors
<&New(255, 255, 255, 1)>Hello!</&>. RGBA color format

Shaking:
<*30, false>Hello!</&>. First value - float, that represents intensity. Second value - bool, that will tell parser, if drawer have to compute shaking offset with Vector2.Lerp(). Note: if you use lerp-ed shaking, intensity should be larger than usual in 10 times.

Sinusoidal moving:
<~false, 2, 1, 1>Who-o-o-o-o!</> First - will symbol move only on Y axis.
